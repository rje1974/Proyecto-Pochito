# Pochito Project

ENG [ESP](https://github.com/rje1974/Proyecto-Pochito/blob/master/README.md)

## Objectives

This project aims to reproduce in Argentina the entire process of planning, development and construction of the robot with which Matt Dotter presented at the [AgBot 2019](https://ag.purdue.edu/agBOT/). In its synthesis it is an example of ROS implementation on the Lawn Mower Mini-Tractor and therefore it starts as a [fork](https://tinyurl.com/y37ajy6b) of the [ROS Lawn Tractor project](https://github.com/ros-agriculture/ros_lawn_tractor) from ROS Agriculture. We consider that the reproduction of this project is a practical exercise so that the academy, metal-mechanical industry and the agricultural sector of Argentina see the potential of this set of technologies and the [appropriation of this set of technologies occurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation%C3%B3n_tecnol%C3%B3gica). In order to achieve the above, the documentation will be emphasized and for this reason we ask you to browse [our wiki](https://github.com/rje1974/ros_lawn_tractor/wiki), which is the heart of the project. Those descriptions include: the software, hardware, feedback, process schematics, and the very experience of ROS implementation in a "little tractor".

## Context

During the last three years I have attended the [AgBot](https://ag.purdue.edu/agBOT/), I was able to personally see the growth of ROS in the agro robotization scene and in these meetings I met [Matt Droter ](https://github.com/droter). As one thing leads to another, Matt offered to lend us a hand in developing a prototype.

## Work plan (12/26/2019)

The work plan is marked by the date of Droter's arrival in Argentina, which is Friday, August 16, 2019 and his departure on August 25, 2019. In general, the work plan includes the following:

- Organize Mr. Droter's trip. (Done)
- Communicate the project. (Done)
- Plan the project. (Done)
- Collect the materials. (Done)
- Test the materials in Trenque Lauquen. (Done)
- Play the process in test mode in Trenque Lauquen. (Done)
- Execute the project at the [Trenque Lauquen digital point](http://pct.trenquelauquen.gov.ar/). (Abandoned)
- Consolidate the assembly. (Done)
- Management of the tractor with control from ROS. (Done)
- Run a path of waypoints. (In process) 12/26/2019 I am still very stuck with the topic of navigation. I intend to put the scrutps of the lauchfiles well here so that whoever can give me a hand. [![Watch the video](/site/Imagenes_Site/youtube.png)](https://youtu.be/XLXWEX2-MHA)

- Document the process and the execution of the project. (In process)

## Thanks

The project was possible thanks to the following:

- [Matt Droter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/droterville/). For obvious reasons.
- [María Riva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-riva-aa78245a/). My sister who in her immense generosity has brought a lot of the electronics of the project on her trips.
- [Luciana Herraiz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luciana-herraiz-8958a1150/), who always supports me in everything and my children, who I hope will use this as a learning tool and break it.
- [Pablo Riva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-alfredo-riva/). My brother who helped me in various aspects of the project and covered potholes during its realization, which otherwise would have been impossible.
- [David Tolosa](https://github.com/davidtolosa). Because he was the first to join and get to work.
- [Manuel Fossati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-fossati-03026561/). Always lending a hand and learning. I contribute many ideas of "how" and "why".
- [Diego Barrios](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-david-barrios-bb84b251/). He guided us in the purchase of the tractor, did all the mechanical maintenance and showed us the electrical part of the tractor to adapt it to the electronics.
- Laurita. She helped me with everything, even the fuses.
- Leo Orsini from [Casa Orsini](https://es-la.facebook.com/casaorsini/), Carlos Ares from [Baterias Ares](https://es-la.facebook.com/pages/category/Automotive--Aircraft---Boat/Baterias-Ares-646753535515544/) and [Ioio Maggio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorio-maggio-b92ab667/) of [SIDER OESTE](http://www.sideroeste.com.ar/index.php), because all this was done at a difficult time in the country and they supplied us with supplies so that we could do the job.
- To the [Ekumen team](https://www.ekumenlabs.com/team/), who invited us to have lunch in BA and we had an interesting talk about ROS and several other things; that they contributed to the product.
- [Agustín Alba Chicar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustin-dario-alba-chicar-6b269846/). He gave us and gives very good advice.
- [Sebastian Carrazotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebascarra/). He gave us a hand with the initial contacts and provided ideas for the initial product.
- [Trenque Lauquen Municipality](http://pct.trenquelauquen.gov.ar/). Especially to [Marcelo Ferreyra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-ferreyra-3257232/) and [Laura Marchabalo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-marchabalo-a497905/ ) that from the digital point of view accompanied us.
- [Maria Fossati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mar%C3%ADa-jos%C3%A9-fossati-151653160/) and [Martin Varela] (<>). That they lent us the premises for the tests.
